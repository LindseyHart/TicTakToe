# TicTakToe
## Description
A Tic Tak Toe game board that keeps track of which player's turn it is. It has clickable buttons that will change from a plus sign at the start to either an X or an O depending on the players turn.

## Future Updates
I want to change up some of the styling to make it less generic and more appealing to players.
